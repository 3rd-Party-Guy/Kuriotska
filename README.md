# Welcome to Kuriotska!
## What is this?
Kuriotksa is a 2D, top-down roguelike featuring random terrain-generation. It tries to combine the graphics of Drawf Fortress with the gameplay of Vampire Survivors, albeit at a much smaller scope.
## What technologies are used?
The game was written exclusively in C++, with curses being the only dependency. Everything else can be found within the short source-code!
## How do I build the game?
You will need to link a valid version of curses to the project for it to compile. I am writing the game with pdcurses in Visual Studio 2022.
